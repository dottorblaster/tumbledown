# Tumbledown
Easily post markdown files to Tumblr.

## Setup
Just issue:

```
npm install -g tumbledown
```

## Usage
Simply issue the post commmand with a path to a markdown file as the argument:

```
$ tumbledown post ~/article.md
```

You can also specify a title:

```
$ tumbledown post ~/article.md -t "This is a title"
```

## Logging in

You will be asked for your Tumblr API keys, and then for the blog post the contents on. That's it.
